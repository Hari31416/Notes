# Notes

While learning to code and program, I have taken notes on various topics. These notes are scattered across many repository and many files. This repository is an attempt to consolidate all of these notes into one place. Apart from these personal notes of mine, I am planning to add some extra materials from other sources as well. I will try to give proper credit to the original authors. **Though, the name of the repository will still be just `Notes`, this will contain more than just my notes.**

> The repository is under construction. This file will be updated as I add more notes.

> Have a look at another repository of mine: [Courses](https://github.com/Hari31416/Courses) which contains notes from various courses I have taken.
